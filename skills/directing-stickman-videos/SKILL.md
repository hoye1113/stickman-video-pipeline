# Directing Stickman Videos

## Core contract

Turn one source into a confirmed director's proposal and then six standalone prompts for approximately ten-second Gemini Omni Flash clips. Preserve the source's meaning while strengthening its hook, progression, and closing callback.

## Setup gate

Require these before planning:

- source material
- aspect ratio: `4:3` (classic horizontal / Academy, recommended default), `16:9`, `9:16`, or `1:1`
- visual style and theme:
  - `Style 2B (Cinematic Story)`: full-color narrative environments, cinematic lighting & depth (recommended default)
  - `Style 2A (Modern Studio Tech)`: pure white high-key studio, subtle light-gray perspective grid, floating cyan/blue glass UI
  - `Style 1 (Classic Minimalist)`: light (white background, black figure) or dark (black background, white figure)

If anything is missing, ask for all missing items in one concise message and stop. If a user specifies horizontal without ratio, default to 4:3. Default style is Style 2B. Never select an aspect ratio or style silently when contradictory. Do not re-ask choices already supplied.

Urgency, generation cost, client pressure, and requests to "pick normal settings" do not waive this gate.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/storyboard-template.md` and `references/style-catalog.md`, then produce Phase A in the user's language, with English VO and a reference translation.
2. Stop after the director's proposal and request explicit approval.
3. If the user changes ratio, style, theme, narration, scene structure, or global direction, recompose Phase A and request approval again.
4. Only after approval of the current Phase A, read `references/omni-flash-prompt-contract.md` and produce Phase B.
5. Use `references/examples.md` only when a concrete end-to-end example would resolve ambiguity.

Topic approval, schedule pressure, or approval of an older draft is not approval of the current Phase A.

## Output rules

- Target 130–150 English VO words across six clips.
- Give each clip three timed beats, at least four relevant visual devices, and a visual change every two to three seconds.
- Keep character proportions, line weight, style, and narrator consistent across all clips.
- For Style 1, limit the video to three saturated accent colors named with ordinary descriptive words (e.g. vivid red, electric blue, warm gold). For light theme, enforce a flat, digitally pure-white canvas with no textures, gradients, or 3D depth.
- For Style 2 (Modern Beanie Zeke), enforce character consistency:
  - Clip 1: `A minimalist 2D animated stick figure wearing a bright red beanie (smooth knit, no pom-pom) and a yellow t-shirt, with simple black stick limbs and shorts. Simple black lines, vibrant colors, smooth 2D animation style.`
  - Clips 2–6: `The same minimalist 2D animated stick figure in a bright red beanie and yellow shirt... Simple black lines, vibrant colors, smooth 2D animation style.`
  - No detailed eyes, pupils, or photorealistic features (avoids bug-eye deformation).
- For Style 2A (Modern Studio Tech), enforce: `in a modern bright white studio space with subtle light-gray perspective grid lines on the floor plane. High-key studio lighting, clean white negative space, sleek glowing cyan and electric blue glass holographic UI elements.` Always include negative constraint: `STRICTLY MINIMALIST, NO CIRCUIT BOARD TEXTURES, NO SCI-FI WALL PANELS, NO CRACKED CONCRETE.`
- For Style 2B (Cinematic Story), specify full-color narrative setting and cinematic lighting while preserving the 2D animated stick-figure character design.
- For all styles, avoid abstract liquid/shape morphing. Drive motion with concrete character actions (leaping, touching glass, drawing luminous lines, opening doors) with timed beats across `[0–3s]`, `[3–7s]`, and `[7–10s]`. Never leave the character idle.
- Lock narrator voice description verbatim across all clips. Mandate BGM continuity from clip 1.
- Treat narration as audio-only (`Audio voiceover only, strictly no speech bubbles, no dialogue boxes`). Quote exact dialogue and forbid alteration, repetition, captions, subtitles, or visual transcription.
- Never place technical color notation (hex, RGB, Pantone) inside generation prompts.
- Default generated clips to no visible words, letters, numbers, or interface copy. Put optional two-to-five-word overlays in a separate post-production note.
- Match every clip ending to the next clip opening.
- Do not invent unsupported facts, statistics, quotations, or product claims.

## Revision rules

Recompose rather than rename:

- `16:9`: stage action across left, center, and right; use lateral tracking and negative space.
- `9:16`: use depth, stacked motion, vertical reveals, and interface-safe placement.
- `1:1`: use compact central composition and shorter travel paths.

Theme or style changes require a fresh visual balance check. A global change invalidates prior approval.

## Final check

Apply the checklist in the loaded reference. Repair any failed condition before responding.
